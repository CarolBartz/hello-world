Consumption Reporting API
#########################

The CORE (Consumption Reporting) API allows developers to develop apps that integrate with the Autodesk CORE platform to fetch their token consumption and better
understand how Autodesk products are used within their organization. Reports on the Account Management Portal are built using these same API's.

Functionality is roughly split into 3 categories:

- *Metadata:* Use these API's to get general information such as contract details and customer provided custom fields.

- *Usage:* Retrieves monthly aggregated usage details including token consumption and unique users or perform ad-hoc analysis and reporting of CORE usage data. For example, an API client may use this endpoint to get a count of tokens consumed by usage category and product name for the last seven days. To get started with the query API, see the `tutorial </en/docs/core/v1/tutorials/query>`_.

- *Export:* These endpoints are used for bulk export of usage data to be delivered via a CSV file. Users can schedule and manage export requests using this API.
